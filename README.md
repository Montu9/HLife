# 🐌 HLife

Implementation of the infinite grid and the hashlife algorithm. The project is done for fun in my spare time.

## 🧐 Features

Hashlife is an advanced algorithm designed for efficiently simulating Conway's Game of Life, a classic cellular automaton. The project assumes client-server architecture to provide ready to use GoL patterns.

#### What is more or less done?

-   File server provide GoL patterns in various extensions.
-   Infinite grid implemented using HTML5 canvas
-   Fundamentals of the Hashlife algorithm

#### TO DO:

-   Improve semantics of the code
-   Fix bugs with rerendering canvas (optimisation)
-   Connect two modules (Hashlife and Infinite grid)
-   Add orchestration technology to the project (Kubernetes/Docker)

## 💻 Tech Stack

**Client:** React (with ViteJS runtime environment), TailwindCSS, Typescript

**Server:** Node, Express, Typescript
